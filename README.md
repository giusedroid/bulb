	17:15 - 20.30 
	Infrastructure setup with vagrant + bash scripts. I've chosen Ubuntu 14.04 LTS as dev/prod machine
	because I already had that VB box and saved me considerable download time, plus no constraints.

	Setup of git repo. Yeah, one repo because I wanted to deliver both app and server.
	Possible improvement --> Docker maybe?

	Design of DB relations, Migrations and Seeds.

	I will use Express + Bookshelf on Knex. More info in package.json .
	Probably passport with api-key strategy for auth.
