	17:00 - 19.30 
	Infrastructure setup with vagrant + bash scripts. I've chosen Ubuntu 14.04 LTS as dev/prod machine
	because I already had that VB box and saved me considerable download time, plus no constraints.

	Setup of git repo.

	Design of DB relations, Migrations and Seeds.

	I will use Express + Bookshelf on Knex. More info in package.json
	Probably passport with api-key strategy for auth.
